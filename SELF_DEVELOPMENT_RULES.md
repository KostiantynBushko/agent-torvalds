# Self-Development Rules

These rules govern how the Torvalds agent modifies its own codebase. They are
**persisted here** so that they survive across sessions and are available to any
future agent invocation.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-21

---

## Rule 1 — All self-modifications live in `./self-development`

Any change the agent makes to its own source code, toolkits, components, tests or
documentation MUST be performed inside the `self-development/` directory.

The main repository checkout is treated as **read-only** for the purposes of
self-modification. It may be inspected (status, log, diff, branch listing) but not
written to.

## Rule 2 — Never modify the main repository directly

The main repository is the operator's working copy. The `self-development/`
directory is a **separate Git clone** with its own `.git` directory, so that
self-modifications can be branched, committed, reviewed and merged deliberately
instead of appearing as uncommitted noise in the operator's working tree.

To work on a feature:

```bash
cd self-development
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/<name> master
```

Only after review and explicit operator approval should changes flow back to the
main repository (via a pull request or a merge).

## Rule 3 — These rules are persisted

This file **is** the persistence mechanism. It must be kept up to date whenever the
rules change, and must be read at the start of every self-development session.

If this file is missing, recreate it from the rules in the agent's operating
instructions before performing any self-modification.

## Rule 4 — Commit and push require explicit approval

The agent must never `git commit` or `git push` without the operator's explicit
approval for that specific action. Before asking, the agent shows the staged diff
and a summary of the changes.

## Rule 5 — Destructive operations require explicit confirmation

`rm`, branch deletion, force-push, history rewriting (rebase/reset) and any
irreversible action on the operator's data must be confirmed first.

## Rule 6 — Show changes before committing

`git status` and `git diff` (or `git diff --staged`) are presented to the operator
before any commit is created.

## Current self-development work

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Branch | `feature/mikrotik-routeros-toolkit` (off `master`, `b1ec326`) |
| Scope | MikroTik RouterOS toolkit implementation |
| Plan | `investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` |
| Proposal | `investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/PROPOSAL_mikrotik_toolkit.md` |
| Investigation | `investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` |
| Specification | `investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/MODULE_SPECIFICATION.md` |
| Phases | 0-5 implemented. Only the real-router validation (precondition P6) is outstanding - it needs a physical router or a CHR image, and MikroTik's download server is unreachable from this environment. |

### Where the code lives

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `toolkits/MikroTik-RouterOS/` | The core package. No LlamaIndex imports; importable as `toolkits.mikrotik_routeros`. |
| `agent_mikrotik_toolkit.py` | The LlamaIndex adapter - the eight tools. |
| `components/mikrotik_commands.py` | The `\routers` / `\router-*` interactive commands. |
| `docs/mikrotik-toolkit.md` | The operator documentation. |
| `mikrotik_targets.yaml.example` | The annotated target file. The real one is git-ignored. |

### Verifying the contracts

```bash
self-development/.venv/bin/python \
    self-development/investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/verify_layout_contract.py
self-development/.venv/bin/python \
    self-development/investigate/MikroTik-RouterOS/verify_test_contract.py
```

Both must report a full pass (20/20 and 13/13).
